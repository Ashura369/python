# learning pass
# pass is a null statement that does nothing, is used as a placeholder for future code

for el in range(5):
    pass

def my_function():
    pass

class MyClass:
    pass

print('this is pass')
# we use pass, when presently we dont want to put any code but in future we might make some changes and put codes, hence we use pass so that we can skip that segment with out putting any code along with avoiding the error

# pass can be used in loops, function, if, and classs. Bascially its a do nothing statement
