# to perform operations on a file (read & write data)
'''
types
    text files      - .txt, .docx, .log, etc (file that stores data in character form like text or symbols)
    binary files    - .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg, etc (file that stores data in any form other than the character form)

    To open a file we have to do below;
        f = open("file_name", "mode") # mode = type read or type write   

        data = f.read()

        f.close()

        
    r  ->	Read mode (default). Opens file for reading. Error if file doesnâ€™t exist.
    w  ->	Write mode. Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.
    x  ->	Exclusive creation. Creates a new file but throws an error if it already exists.
    a  ->	Append mode. Opens file for writing, adds content at the end without deleting existing data.
    b  ->	Binary mode. Used for files like images, videos, etc. (rb, wb).
    t  ->	Text mode (default). Used for text files (rt, wt).
    +  ->	Update mode. Allows reading + writing together (r+, w+, a+).
